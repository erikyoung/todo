# README

A javascript web app integrated into Rails. This web app allows you to create a simple to do list that will allow you to update and keep track of what work that has not been finished. 

This is a database-driven web application that doesn't use any page refreshes to update the page. Instead, it will fetch data using RESTful JSON APIs from Rails and use JavaScript to dynamically update the page.
